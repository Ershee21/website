        <p6> Spirited Away (Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, literally translated as "Sen and Chihiro's Spiriting Away"),
            is the 12th animated film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli, and premiered in
            theaters in Japan on July 20, 2001.
            The story is about the adventures of a young ten-year-old girl named Chihiro as she wanders into the world of the
            gods and spirits. She is forced to work at a bathhouse following her parents being turned into pigs by the witch
            Yubaba. The film was made to please the ten-year-old daughter of Hayao Miyazaki's personal friend, director Seiji
            Okuda. Okuda's daughter even became the model for the film's protagonist, Chihiro. During the film's planning phase,
            Miyazaki gathered the daughters of Ghibli's staff in a mountain hut in Shinano Province to hold a training seminar.
            His experience led him to wanting to make a film for them, since he had never made a movie for girls at the age of 10.
            The film earned a massive ¥31,680 billion in Japan, a record only beaten by Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie:
            Mugen Train in 2020.[1] It received multiple international awards, including the Golden Bear Award at the 52nd Berlin
            International Film Festival and the second Oscar ever awarded for Best Animated Feature, the first anime film to win an
            Academy Award, and the only winner of that award to win among five nominees. Due to his efforts in promoting the film
            in North America, John Lasseter, one of the founding fathers of Pixar, became the executive producer of the English dub.
            It won first place in the Studio Ghibli general poll held in 2016, and was re-screened in five movie theaters around Japan for seven days from September 10 to 16, 2016. It was adapted as a stage play by John Caird, starring Kanna Hashimoto and Mone Kamishiraishi, and debuted in February 2022 in Tokyo, Japan and premiered in April 2023 in the United States.[2]

            The film is available for streaming on Max, and purchasable on most digital storefronts.</p6>
